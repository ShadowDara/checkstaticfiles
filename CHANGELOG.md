# v0.1.0
[checkstaticfiles][csfv0.1.0] - [csf.generate][csfgv0.1.0]
- changed description in the Readme and the changelog
- [x] BIG PROBLEM: binary searches for the files from the execution path not the located path
- [x] programm checks the content of the files too *(contentmode: true/false)*

### Content Mode
a feature which allows to check the content of the files too, so that
users cant change it and execute the programm with the changed files then

to configure, add to the `checkstaticfiles.config.yaml`, but this will result in longer file
cheking time, keep that in mind

```yaml
contentmode: false
# or true
```
